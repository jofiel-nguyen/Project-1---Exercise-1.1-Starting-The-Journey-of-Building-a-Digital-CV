### Project-1---Exercise-1.1-Starting-The-Journey-of-Building-a-Digital-CV
## Description
This project marks the initial step in building a dynamic and interactive digital curriculum vitae (CV). It serves as a foundational exercise to establish the basic structure and content of a personal online resume, focusing on core web technologies to present professional information effectively.

This initial version lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including interactive elements, design improvements, and advanced features.

Basic Styling: Applies fundamental CSS for readability and a clean aesthetic.

Responsive Design (Initial): Aims for basic responsiveness to ensure content is viewable on various screen sizes.

Semantic HTML: Uses appropriate HTML5 elements to define the structure and meaning of the content.
